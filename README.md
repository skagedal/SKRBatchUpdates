## SKRBatchUpdates

This is here mostly because of the Tetris demo that I wrote about [in a blog post](https://skagedal.github.io/2018/08/23/collection-view-tetris.html). 

**Please instead see the [Tetris Diffing Competition](https://github.com/skagedal/TetrisDiffingCompetition) repo, which contains the same code and some more stuff!**
